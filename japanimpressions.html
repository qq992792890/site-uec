  Japan Impressions of mine will start from here
  <hr size=1>
  <p>
    Japan is an amazing country, with a logt of diliciuous food, i like ramen here. There are many Ramen shop here, many
    of them taste very good.
    There are also many interesting festivals.
    There are many beautiful sites here.

    Japan has wonderful food, great shopping and unlimited and top quality choices of entertainment. And people here are
    very kind.

    Japanese people seem to be very hard-working and I think that'ss acknowledged all over the world. And Japanese music
    seems very conservative.

    Japan is a very safe country without much crime. Japanese are very modern, but they still respect and hold onto
    their traditions.

    For what's considered to be such a conservative country, the Japanese people don't seem to be afraid to express
    themselves.

    Accommodation owners provided the most detailed instructions I've ever seen for finding them, often including
    multi-page PDFs with maps, annotated photographs, and several paragraphs of text. In smaller towns, we were picked
    up from the train station, with offers to drive us around to see the main attractions.

    The culture and language differences could make travelling in Japan extremely difficult, but in general, it really
    isn't.

    Huge crowds are normal at major train stations, but nobody seems to get upset about it!
    Nice to meet you all!
