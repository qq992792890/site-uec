  <p>1. Fiber-optic communications that underpin the convenience of smartphones</p>
  <p><img src="./images/labimg1.jpg" width="384" height="259" class="float_l">
    What is the fastest and largest-capacity surface communication method? Fiber-optic communications. As its name
    suggests, fiber-optic communications is a method of transmitting signals through an optical fiber, which is a long
    and narrow transparent fiber. Optical fibers consist of a small core and a cladding. Signals are transmitted by
    passing light through this core.
  </p>
  <p>Recently, wireless communication usage has skyrocketed with mobile phones, smartphones, tablets, and other wireless
    devices. Wireless communications is a method of sending signals by propagating electromagnetic waves through air.
    While light is also a type of electromagnetic wave, because of light physical properties, optical signals have much
    higher carrier frequency than the electromagnetic waves used in wireless communications. In other words, the amount
    of data that fiber-optic communications can send is much larger than that of wireless communications (see Figure 1).
    This is why fiber-optic communications are nearly always chosen for applications where large volumes of data must be
    conveyed, such as trunk lines and backbones at the core of a communication system.</p>
  <p>But just how much data can a fiber-optic communication line transmit? At the experimental level, optical-fiber data
    transmission speeds of one petabit (Pbit) per second have been obtained. One petabit is one quadrillion (1015) bits.
    And how much data is that? equivalent to sending 5,000 two-hour HDTV movies in one second�E(Associate Professor
    Matsuura). Putting it another way, if 5,000 users try to download a two-hour HDTV movie at the same time, all the
    downloads will be completed in just one second. Suffice to say, it an incredible amount of data.</p>


  <p>2. Optical signal processing for higher speeds and lower power consumption</p>
  <img src="./images/labimg2.jpg" width="384" height="265" class="float_r">
  <p>The Matsuura laboratory research looks at ways of advancing fiber-optic communications. This research covers three
    basic topics. The first research topic is ultra-fast optical signal processing technology with an aim toward
    attaining the maximum possible speeds and performance levels. The second topic is disaster-resilient communication
    technology that fuses fiber-optic communications and wireless communications, called Radio-over-fiber�E And the
    third is research into fiber-optic transmission technology using state-of-the-art optical fiber (see Figure 2).</p>
  <img src="./images/labimg3.jpg" width="384" height="269" class="float_l">
  <p>The first topic, ultra-fast optical signal processing technology, is a key technology for future optical networks.
    Optical networks consist of optical nodes where optical signals are sent and received and optical links that join
    the nodes (see Figure 3). At present, optical nodes convert input optical signals into electrical signals to process
    the signals with electronic circuitry. The processed electrical signals are converted back to optical signals and
    output on the optical links. With this method, however, increasing the speed of the electronic circuitry results in
    steep increases in power consumption. Since higher power consumption is no longer feasible given today focus on
    energy conservation, higher speeds than what we have today may well be impractical.</p>
  <img src="./images/labimg4.jpg" width="384" height="279" class="float_r">
  <p>As an alternative, researchers are looking at equipping nodes with optical signal-processing circuitry, which
    performs signal processing on unconverted optical signals. Research is going in this direction because optical
    signal-processing circuitry operates at much faster speeds than electronic circuitry while, it is hoped, consuming
    much less power.</p>
  <p>One example of the Matsuura laboratory research into optical signal processing is ultra-fast wavelength conversion,
    developed in partnership with the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands. The laboratory has
    demonstrated wavelength conversions of optical signal at speeds of up to 320 Gbit/s (see Figure 4).</p>
